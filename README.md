# TravelingSalesmanProblem_ClassProject_Python

## Overview

This project is a collection of various Python files written for the Practical Optimization class.

The project's focus is on solving the TSP using different algorithms.

---

All files are part of one of three mini projects

- Mini Project 1 consists of `tsp.py`, `CitiesAndDistances.txt`, `ResultSet1.md`, and the corresponding README files. The focus of Mini Project 1 was on solving the TSP using brute force, 2-opt, and simulated annealing, as well as comparing the results.
- Mini Project 3 consists of `artificial_statistician.py` and the corresponding README files. The focus of Mini Project 3 was on evaluating the performance of algorithms.
- Mini Project 2 consists of all leftover Python files and the corresponding README files. The focus of Mini Project 2 was on the `algorithms_HC_EA.py` file, where we implemented our own EA algorithm by combining various strategies we learned during class.

*Some of the files were provided as is by our professor. We only implemented certain aspects.*
